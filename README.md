# Coffee
## What is Coffee?
No, not the drink, you already know what that is. Coffee is a JavaScript library created by @D3vpz in late 2023. It aims to make creating games in JavaScript as simple and straightforward as possible, requiring little to no need to look at a documentation(it is still reccommended, though).
## How do I get started?
You can check out either coffee or coffeelite. Coffee lite is a more bare bones version designed to be more lightweight while Coffee is the full version.
## Any future plans?
As of now, development on Coffee has been slow. We will probably migrate Coffee Lite to become the official Coffee verison. Also, we are currently working on a more fleshed out and polished version of Coffe with more features, named Frappuccino.
